## Overview

- **Unique URLs.** Use a custom shortened URL for your URL, or use a generated one.
- **Leaderboard.** View the top links clicked on.
- **Accounts.** Sign in and have all of your URLs in one place.
- **Dark mode.** Create and manage your shortened URLs in the dark.

## Build setup

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) are required.

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn

# server with hot reload on port 3000
yarn dev

# build for production and launch the server
yarn build
yarn start
```

The final product is also hosted temporarily [here](https://tny-snls.xyz/).

## To-do

- Test components separately (unit tests)
- Write more end-to-end tests

Right now the basic functionality of creating shortened urls is tested. Other functionalities like login and leaderboard couldn't be tested in time.
